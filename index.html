			<div class="selfDescription">
				<p>I have been on the computer for years now. I started interacting with them back in the good old days of dial-up when the internet wasn't all that popular. Immediately after high school, I learned how to break down a computer and put them together. This skill helped me assemble my current computer! Now, I'm learning to put finish out my programming skills and show off these skills in the workplace.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I enjoyed my trip to Seoul, South Korea and Tokyo, Japan. So I decided to put some info about them in the back. My interest aren't many but I do enjoy learning random things all the time. I enjoy reading about history especially when it comes to military history. I also enjoy gaming on the side to relax. Most of all just enjoy being all the computer then to surf the internet and see where I end up that day.</p>
